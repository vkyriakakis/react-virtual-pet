## Features
- You have to keep the pet alive by feeding, watering and playing with it.
- Depending on how you raise it, it can take on many different colors and 27 different appearance combinations as it grows up.
- There is support for multiple saved games. 

## How to run

2) Your pet starts its life in the egg stage. While in this stage,
you can keep it alive by using the Heat, Cold, and Life actions. They
also make the pet redder, bluer and greener respectively.

3) After some time has passed, the egg hatches and the gameplay changes. You
have to keep the pet well-fed by using the Feed action, watered by using the
Water action, and keep its love high by using the Play and/or Study actions.
If any of these needs goes to 0, the pet dies. 

4) The Play action increases the Strength stat and the Study action the Intelligence stat.
The relationship between these stats determines the appearance of the ears, arms and legs
the pet will grow. Try different combinations of these stats to get different looking pets.
